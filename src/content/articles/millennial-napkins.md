excerpt: "Major napkin manufacturers blame younger generation for preferring paper towels and questioning the need for specialized cloth squares."

The National Napkin Association held an emergency press conference today to address what they're calling "the napkin crisis" - young adults are simply not buying napkins at the rate previous generations did.

## The Complaint

"Millennials are destroying our industry," declared NNA President Richard Hastings. "They're using paper towels, or worse - nothing at all. They're eating over the sink like barbarians."

Industry analysts point to several millennial behaviors that threaten the napkin market:

- Using paper towels instead of napkins
- Washing and reusing cloth napkins (reducing replacement purchases)
- Eating directly from containers, eliminating the need for formal table settings
- Living in small apartments with limited storage for napkin-specific items

## The Response

Millennials were quick to respond to the accusations on social media.

"I'm sorry I can't afford napkins because I spent all my money on avocado toast and the three jobs I need to pay rent," tweeted @BrokeBut Woke.

"They want us to have different types of paper for different uses?" questioned another user. "That's the same energy as having a living room you're not allowed to live in."

## Industry Solutions

The napkin industry is attempting to appeal to younger consumers with new products:

- **Millennial Pink Napkins**: Same as regular napkins but marked up 40%
- **Artisanal Napkins**: Hand-crafted by local napkin artists
- **Eco-Friendly Napkins**: Regular napkins with green packaging
- **Smart Napkins**: Connected to an app that reminds you to use napkins

## Other Industries Affected

The napkin crisis is just the latest in a series of industries reportedly being "killed" by millennials, including:

- Casual dining chains
- Department stores
- Golf courses
- Homeownership
- Having children
- The concept of financial security

"Perhaps," suggested economist Dr. James Wilson, "if these industries paid millennials living wages, they could afford to buy more napkins."

The napkin industry rejected this suggestion, stating it was "too radical."
