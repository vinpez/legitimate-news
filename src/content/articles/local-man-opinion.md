---

Local resident Dave Thompson, 47, who has never studied economics, climate science, or public health, announced today that his gut feelings about these subjects are just as valid as expert consensus.

## The Claims

Thompson, who spends approximately 15 minutes per day reading social media posts, believes his opinions on the following topics deserve equal consideration:

- International trade policy
- Vaccine efficacy
- Climate change mitigation strategies
- Quantum physics
- Brain surgery techniques

"I just know things," Thompson explained while scrolling through his phone. "It's called common sense."

## Expert Response

Dr. Emily Chen, who holds a PhD in Economics and has published over 50 peer-reviewed papers, was asked to comment on Thompson's economic theories.

"That's... not how any of this works," Dr. Chen stated, looking visibly confused.

## Media Coverage

Despite having no credentials or relevant experience, Thompson's opinions have been featured on several news networks under the banner of "providing balanced coverage."

"We believe it's important to present both sides," explained news producer Mark Stevens. "On one side, we have scientists with decades of research. On the other, we have Dave. It's only fair."

## Thompson's Background

When asked about his qualifications, Thompson noted that he "watches a lot of YouTube videos" and "has a cousin who knows stuff."

The story continues to develop as Thompson prepares to share his thoughts on nuclear fusion later this week.
