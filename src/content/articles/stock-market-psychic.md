Madame Zelda, a self-proclaimed financial psychic, has made her bold predictions for the upcoming quarter: the stock market will either rise, fall, or stay roughly the same.

## The Prediction

Speaking from her crystal-adorned office, Madame Zelda gazed into her crystal ball and shared her insights with reporters.

"I see... movement," she declared dramatically. "The markets will definitely move. Possibly upward. Perhaps downward. The spirits are showing me... numbers. Numbers that will change."

## Track Record

Madame Zelda boasts an impressive track record of being "technically correct" approximately 100% of the time, primarily because her predictions cover all possible outcomes.

"She said stocks would move, and they did!" exclaimed satisfied client Robert Martinez. "It's uncanny how accurate she is."

## Services Offered

Madame Zelda offers several financial services:

- **Basic Reading**: $500 - "Something will happen"
- **Premium Reading**: $1,000 - "Several things will happen"
- **Deluxe Package**: $5,000 - "Things will happen, and I'll provide dates from the calendar"

## Comparison to Actual Financial Analysts

Financial analyst David Kim from Goldman Sachs was asked to comment on Madame Zelda's methods.

"I mean, we essentially do the same thing but with more complicated words and better PowerPoint presentations," Kim admitted.

## Client Testimonials

"Madame Zelda told me to diversify my portfolio by investing in 'things that may increase in value,'" shared investor Lisa Thompson. "Best advice I ever received."

Madame Zelda is available for private consultations and corporate speaking engagements.
