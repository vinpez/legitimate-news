After years of rigorous testing and peer review, a team of leading scientists at the Institute of Obvious Research has published their findings confirming that water is, indeed, wet.

## The Study

The comprehensive study involved over 10,000 participants who were asked to touch water and report their findings. The results were unanimous: 100% of participants agreed that water felt wet.

"This is a monumental discovery," said lead researcher Dr. Sarah Mitchell. "We can now say with absolute certainty that water possesses the quality of wetness."

## Implications

The findings are expected to have far-reaching implications across multiple industries:

- **Fashion Industry**: Designers can now confidently create water-resistant clothing
- **Swimming Pools**: Pool operators can finally explain why people get wet when swimming
- **Beverage Industry**: Drink manufacturers may need to update their labels

## Public Reaction

The public response has been mixed, with some praising the research while others questioned why it took so long to reach this conclusion.

"I've been saying this for years," commented local resident Tom Johnson. "But I'm glad science has finally caught up."

## What's Next?

The research team is now turning their attention to investigating whether fire is hot, with preliminary results expected sometime in 2028.
