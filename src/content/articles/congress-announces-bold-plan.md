In a rare display of unified purpose, Congress has announced the creation of a bipartisan committee to explore the feasibility of forming a task force that may, in the future, outline steps toward developing a plan.

The committee — officially titled the *Joint Preliminary Strategic Review Panel on Potential Planning Initiatives* (JPSRPPI) — will be tasked with determining whether thinking about planning might be appropriate at this time.

## A Historic Announcement

“We are proud to have taken concrete action to begin consideration of the possibility of action,” said Senator Elaine Walker (D), who will serve as the committee's co-chair. “This is what government is about: process. And we are committed to that process.”

Her counterpart, Representative Grant Willis (R), agreed.  
“There are many pressing issues in this country,” Willis said. “And while we are currently unable to agree on solutions, or problems, or meeting times, we can agree that considering the outline of a framework for possible future solutions is an important step.”

## Mandate and Scope

The committee’s official scope includes:

- Determining whether a task force should be formed  
- Discussing the appropriate language to describe the process of determining the possible formation of said task force  
- Scheduling follow-up meetings to reschedule earlier canceled meetings  
- Disputing who should take notes  

Decisions are expected to be nonbinding, provisional, symbolic, or all three.

## Public Reaction

Public response has been mixed.

“I’m glad they’re finally doing something,” said local resident Angela Harmon, who admitted she was unclear on what, specifically, that something was.

Political analyst Greg Chalmers was more skeptical.  
“We've seen committees like this before,” he explained. “The last major one spent eight months deciding whether they should meet in a conference room or via Zoom. They ultimately compromised by meeting nowhere.”

## Next Steps

The committee’s first scheduled meeting has already been postponed due to disagreements over the color of the meeting folder.

A statement from the committee assures the nation that “progress is ongoing,” though it did not clarify in which direction.
